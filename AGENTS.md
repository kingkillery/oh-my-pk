# Development Rules

## Scope

- Primary package: `packages/coding-agent/`; “agent” normally means this implementation.
- Other packages: `ai`, `catalog`, `agent`, `tui`, `natives`, `stats`, `utils`, `llm-router-agent`, and `crates/pi-natives`.
- Import catalog values from `@pk-nerdsaver-ai/pi-catalog/<module>`, never `pi-ai`. Type-only `Model`, `Api`, `ThinkingConfig`, and `Effort` imports from `pi-ai` are allowed.
- Keep changes scoped; review logical clusters before staging. Never commit unless asked.
- Collaboration rules: [docs/multi-agent-fork-collaboration.md](docs/multi-agent-fork-collaboration.md). Surface boundaries: [docs/fork-boundaries.md](docs/fork-boundaries.md).
- Deeper `AGENTS.md` files contain package-specific rules; read them before editing those directories.
- Before editing `packages/coding-agent/` or `packages/catalog/`, read that package's `AGENTS.md`.

- Colab is general compute by default; `/colab-model` or explicit inference establishes model intent.
- Fresh agents MUST inspect existing sessions first, offer connection when compatible, and provision only when requested.
- Treat runtime, served model, bridge, provider registration, and harness generation as separate evidence gates.

## PR 45 convergence policy

- Treat `main` as the production baseline. PR 45 and `codex/pr45-minimal-reconciliation` are donor branches, not merge bases.
- Do not merge or rebase the full PR 45 history into `main`. Port one coherent behavior lane at a time from a named donor commit, adapting it to current `main` architecture.
- Pull only items marked **Pull into main** in [`.wiki/concepts/pr45-convergence.md`](.wiki/concepts/pr45-convergence.md). Items marked **Already in main** are verification anchors, not work to replay.
- Before editing, prove that `main` does not already provide the behavior or a newer equivalent. Prefer the current `main` design when both exist.
- Each port requires an observable contract, focused tests, package typecheck/lint, and a final union check after integration. Harness-only success does not make a source branch merge-ready.
- Preserve the fork boundaries in `docs/fork-boundaries.md`. In particular, CoLab, Hub/IRC, pk-speak `/remote`, SSH, and remote-workspace transports have distinct lifetimes and API contracts.
- Optimize provider caching by keeping stable prompt prefixes byte-stable and appending dynamic context late. Never trade away required instructions, tool schemas, or safety context merely to increase cache hits.
- The durable rationale and lane order live in [`.wiki/concepts/pr45-convergence.md`](.wiki/concepts/pr45-convergence.md).

## Kade context

- Use `C:\Users\prest\.agents\kade.md` and `human.md` as the minimal machine-level bootstrap; load the `kade-hq` skill for detailed rules.
- Unqualified “update the wiki” requests route to the repository `.wiki/` for project documentation; the two external vaults (`C:\dev\Vaults\Kade` and `C:\dev\Vaults\Design-and-Building`) remain explicit Kade destinations.
- The `pk-has-adhd` reference is supplemental and does not override repository-local instructions.

## Machine & compute context (pk)

- This machine runs parallel agent sessions (e.g. pr-45 verification) with their own `bun`/`node` processes. Never taskkill `bun.exe`/`node.exe` broadly — kill only processes whose CommandLine matches your own script (filter `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` on CommandLine).
- Heavy verification (full test suites, binary builds) may be offloaded to the `msi` peer via `cd C:/dev/Infra/ompk-remote && bun run remote.mjs auto --bg -- bun test <file>`; test-class commands route to msi by policy, light commands stay local. See that script's header for the full surface.

## Code

- Avoid `any` and `ReturnType<>`; use ES `#private` fields and methods.
- Use `Promise.withResolvers()`, not the constructor pattern.
- Prefer Bun APIs; use `node:*` only where Bun lacks coverage.
- In async flows avoid sync I/O, unnecessary copies, and repeated `Bun.file()` calls.
- Never run `tsc` or `npx tsc`; use `bun check`.

## Testing

- Test externally observable behavior: output, transitions, errors, and regression-prone boundaries.
- Prefer focused contract or integration tests. Do not add placeholders, tautologies, mocks, or source-text assertions.
- Keep tests full-suite safe: restore spies per test and never use `mock.module()`.
- Exercise real lifecycle transitions and failures. Skip tests only for tiny edits without contract impact.

## Changelog and release

- Add package entries only under `## [Unreleased]`; released sections are immutable.
- Never create GitHub issues/comments or run release/commit commands unless the user asks.
