it. `INAPPLICABLE_TOOLS` are tools that cannot help a single headless task by construction
(orchestration, scheduling, session memory, interactive questions). `judge_tools_for_task` is
the paid, instruction-aware judge: it reads the task text and the catalog and says which tools
to load for THIS task, never dropping a protected one.
