"""The loop guard's two optional paid calls: a stuck judge and a redirect writer.

Both read the same leakage-safe digest of the agent's recent actions
(`SpiralState.recent_digest`: commands, searches, edited file basenames, error signatures --
never file contents or the task text). The judge decides stuck-versus-productive when the free
gate is open; the writer turns the redirect from a count template into one that names the
pattern it sees. Each returns its effective-token cost so the caller can charge it to the
session's ledger, and falls back to the free path on any failure.
